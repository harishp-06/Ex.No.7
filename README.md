# Date:
# Register no.
# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required: 

  -> ChatGPT (GPT-5 or GPT-4)

  -> (Optional) Python / Web interface for user interaction

  -> Prompt Engineering techniques

# Explanation: 

This experiment focuses on designing a Personal Productivity Assistant using prompt engineering.
The assistant should:

 ! Manage and organize daily tasks
 ! Set and schedule reminders
 ! Suggest wellness and productivity tips
 ! Answer general user queries
 ! Adapt to user preferences over time through feedback

## Prompt:

"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."

## Procedure:

Step 1: Define Core Requirements
Identify the main functions of the assistant:

-> Task management
-> Scheduling and reminders
-> Wellness tips
-> General query answering
-> Preference adaptation

### Step 2: Construct Appropriate Prompts

| **Feature**                 | **Sample Prompt**                                                            | **Example Output**                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Task Manager**            | “Add ‘Finish AI report by 5 PM’ to my task list and show all pending tasks.” | Task List: <br> 1️⃣ Finish AI report – Due: 5 PM <br> 2️⃣ Attend team meeting – 3 PM |
| **Smart Scheduler**         | “Schedule a 30-min workout in the morning and show my free time slots.”      | 🗓 Free Time: 7–8 AM, 6–7 PM <br> ✅ Workout scheduled for 7:00–7:30 AM               |
| **Wellness Tips Generator** | “Give me today’s wellness advice.”                                           | 💡 Tip: Drink 2L of water and take a 10-min screen break every 2 hours.              |
| **General Query**           | “What’s the best way to improve focus while studying?”                       | 🧠 Response: Use the Pomodoro technique – study 25 mins, rest 5 mins.                |
| **Adaptive Behavior**       | “I prefer evening workouts. Update my schedule accordingly.”                 | 🔄 Acknowledged. Future workouts will be planned for 6:30–7:00 PM.                   |
